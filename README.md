CLI test project to implement a rudimentary login system with accounts and passwords utilising SHA256 encryption and password salting.

Do not try and add anything to this repository via pull requests, as it will not be implemented. Issues will be discussed between us however.
Please dont expect any high levels of quality here as it is entirely experimentation between us and comes with no guarantee of functionality.
